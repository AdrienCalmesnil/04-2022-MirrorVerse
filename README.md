## Welcome to the MirrorVerse
 Our objective is to create a connected mirror using image analysis to offer various functionalities: Personal assistant, intrusion detection, videoconferencing, screen-casting and innovative IMH. But also and above all immersion in the metaverse: immersive videoconferencing, superposition of physical / digital signals to try on clothes, hairstyles or accessories.
    In order to carry out this project, we will use a one-way mirror equipped with screens on the back as well as a camera, a microphone and a microcomputer. We will approach this project incrementally, starting by implementing the basic functionalities of a connected object and assembling the mirror and its various hardware modules. This phase will allow us to set up our working methods and our team organization. In a second step we will implement the basic image analysis functionalities: facial recognition, action recognition. This phase will allow us to test our solution in terms of performance, one of the critical technical points of our solution. Finally, we will tackle the physical/digital superposition, the flagship features of our device, but also the one that presents the greatest technical challenge.
