# Welcome to the MirrorVerse
 Our objective is to create a connected mirror using image analysis to offer various functionalities: Personal assistant, intrusion detection, videoconferencing, screen-casting and innovative IMH. But also and above all immersion in the metaverse: immersive videoconferencing, superposition of physical / digital signals to try on clothes, hairstyles or accessories.
    In order to carry out this project, we will use a one-way mirror equipped with screens on the back as well as a camera, a microphone and a microcomputer. We will approach this project incrementally, starting by implementing the basic functionalities of a connected object and assembling the mirror and its various hardware modules. This phase will allow us to set up our working methods and our team organization. In a second step we will implement the basic image analysis functionalities: facial recognition, action recognition. This phase will allow us to test our solution in terms of performance, one of the critical technical points of our solution. Finally, we will tackle the physical/digital superposition, the flagship features of our device, but also the one that presents the greatest technical challenge.

Neutralinojs is a lightweight and portable desktop application development framework. It lets you develop lightweight cross-platform desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Apps built with Neutralinojs can run on Linux, macOS, Windows, Web, and Chrome. Also, you can extend Neutralinojs with any programming language (via extensions IPC) and use Neutralinojs as a part of any source file (via child processes IPC).

### Setup the environment
In this project, we are using the javascript library neutralino.js. It lets you develop lightweight cross-platform desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
First, `git clone` the project wherever you want in your computer
`npm install` to install all the dependencies
 
 
 ### To run the app
 `neu run`
 
 
 ### Building your app (No compilation - takes less than a second)
 `neu build`
